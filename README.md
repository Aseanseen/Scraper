#Objective of ResumeME

To craft the path for each individual to find and be prepared for embarking on their journey to success with the perfect job.

#Inspiration

The typical job seeker spends **3 - 4 hours** preparing and submitting 1 application while 72% of employers spend **less than 15 minutes** reviewing an application. Additionally, there are articles indicating that one should reduce the number of applications they send out, but rather spend that time customising their application for every position.

#What it does

ResumeME allows **quick customisation** of one's resume to fit the job position. This ensures that the user will have a **customised version of his/her resume** for every job, increasing the chances for an interview and smoothening the job application process.
